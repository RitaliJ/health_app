# The Virtual Hospital
Submission for EVPC Hacks (Health-tech theme)

## Description

The Virtual Hospital is a web app intended to be a one-stop shop for patients to access medical services and assistance online. 
Doctors tend to be busy, and appointments cannot always be scheduled on a timely basis. Additionally, hospitals and other medical institutions can be inaccessible for many people, such as those residing in rural areas.</p>

Currently, the Virtual Hospital offers a chatbot, which can consumers can use to demystify medical terminology or answer their questions. In the future, other medical services could be added, such as a machine-learning powered dermatological tool to assess skin lesions and determine whether they are cancerous or not.

## Development 

The front-end (website) of the health_app was constructed using Javascript, HTML, and CSS, and the back-end (chatbot) was developed using Python.

It relies on the Flask framework in order to connect the logic in Python to the website through the Javascript file. 
After installing Python and Flask, you will need to install 

pip install nltk 
Nltk - Natural Language Processing with Python
pip install newspaper3k
Newspaper3k - Python library used for Web Scraping articles
pip install sklearn
Sklearn - useful library for machine learning in Python

## Sources

The corpus for medical terms was collected by using data from www.health.harvard.edu
